## Commit Policy

- **Claude writes commit messages** following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- **Claude creates commits** — but only when explicitly asked by the user
- **Claude never pushes** to any remote, under any circumstances
- **Claude never force-pushes, amends published commits, or resets hard** without explicit user instruction

When asked to commit, Claude stages the relevant files and commits immediately — no confirmation step.
